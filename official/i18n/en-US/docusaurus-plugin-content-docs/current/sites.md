- [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/) - The news article is an old format, designed for over a century of printed newspapers, but it is showing its age.Too much news - even some of today's best news - intertwines facts and analysis so closely that readers have trouble telling the difference between the two.Articles are not always honest in providing opposing viewpoints. Moreover, they are usually told from a single perspective.All of this makes it hard for time-constrained readers to believe - or even understand - the big picture.Thus, we reconstructed the story form into what we call Semaform.This format separates indisputable facts from journalists' analysis of those facts, providing a different and more comprehensive viewpoint and sharing other media's strong coverage of the topic.
- [Noema Magazine - Reflections](https://www.noemamag.com/) - Publishes articles, interviews, reports, videos, and artwork on the intersection of philosophy, governance, geopolitics, economics, technology, and culture.In doing so, our unique approach is to step out of the usual realm and cross disciplinary, social segregation and cultural boundaries.From artificial intelligence and the climate crisis to the future of democracy and capitalism, Noema Magazine seeks a deeper understanding of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century.
