# PDF File Translation

Immersive Translation's PDF bilingual translation comes in two versions: [Free Version](https://app.immersivetranslate.com/file/) and [PDF Pro](https://app.immersivetranslate.com/pdf-pro/). The free version only supports standard PDF documents (non-scanned), while PDF Pro supports more complex PDF documents, including scanned versions, formula recognition, and features paragraph-by-paragraph bilingual comparison. Multi-column content is automatically reformatted into single columns.

## Free PDF Translation

1. For online PDF files, after opening them in your browser, click the extension icon and then click "Translate this file" as shown below.
