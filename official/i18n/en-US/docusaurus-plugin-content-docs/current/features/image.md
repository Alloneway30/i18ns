Right-click on any image and select "Translate Image" to translate it. Additionally, if you have set up a mouse hover shortcut for paragraph translation, you can also use that shortcut to translate images. For convenience, you can enable the mouse hover quick translation button below. Once enabled, when you hover your mouse over any image, you'll see a "Quick Translate" button. Click this button to translate the image. More customization options are available in [Settings] -> [Comics/Images].

### Free Version Image Translation

Text recognition is processed directly in the browser. Due to browser technology limitations, it's currently only supported in Chrome and Edge, and language recognition is limited to English and some Latin-based languages.

### Pro Version Image Translation

Text recognition is processed on the server side, supporting all browsers compatible with **Immersive Translation**. Most common languages are supported, but this feature is currently only available for [Pro members](https://immersivetranslate.com/auth/pricing/?utm_source=officialSite&utm_medium=usageDoc&utm_campaign=usageDocImage).
