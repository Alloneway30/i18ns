Or you can just set the specified shortcut keys in [Interface Settings] [Shortcut Key Settings].

## How do I trigger it on my phone?

It's also triggered on mobile by clicking the quick share button on the page：

However, on cell phones, due to the limitations of the device, this button is not easy to display, because in order to display this button, you must click on the [Quick Translate] button, and at this time, it may make the article that has already been translated, go back to the original state.So here's a little trick, is to slightly drag this shortcut button, this will also make the share button expand, at this time click on the [Share] button.
