## Precautions

- Currently, this service does not support Hong Kong IP, [view supported regions](https://ai.google.dev/available_regions)
- According to some user feedback, when using Gemini for translation in Immersive Translate, due to IP (such as shared IP) or frequency reasons, it may be judged by Google Cloud as abuse, leading to the API Key or Google Cloud account being disabled. Please use with caution, or consider using a secondary account.
